## Note

These files are archived because:
1. They document features/changes that are now part of the main codebase
2. They may be superseded by newer documentation in the main docs folder
3. They're kept for historical reference and context

For current documentation, see the main docs folder:
- Start with `../0-INDEX.md` for navigation
- Current architecture: `../2-FRONTEND-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Development guide: `../5-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md`
